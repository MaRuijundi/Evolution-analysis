# Evolution-analysis
Tracing the evolution of green logistics
## Database
All the data related to the revolution analysis has been uploaded.

## LDA topic model
We use R programming to obtain the hot topics in three stages of green logistics development. The code in each phase can be found in the files.

## Text similarity calculation
We use Python code to calculate the similarity of each main topic in different stages. Python code is realized by Jupyter.

## Software
